# MVVM with Kotlin


# Description  

This is a app was created to show some examples of how to use ViewBinding, LiveData, and Navigation Component following the MVVM Architecture pattern.

# Intended User

This app is for developers to learn how to use the new technologies for android using the Kotlin language.

# Features 


*   ViewBinding is being utilized with save a lot of code if you are used to use ButterKnife or FindViewById.
*   LiveData is being utilized which help you to preserve the data and there is no need to use the onSaveInstanceState method.
*   Navigation Component is being used which is more cleaner and easier to use. No need to use bundle anymore.

# Key Considerations 


### **How will your app handle data persistence? ** 

   This project uses LiveData


### **Describe any libraries you'll be using and share your reasoning for including them.**



*   RecyclerView
*   Navigation Component
*   Material Design
